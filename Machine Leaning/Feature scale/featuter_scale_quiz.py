""" quiz materials for feature scaling clustering """

### FYI, the most straightforward implementation might
### throw a divide-by-zero error, if the min and max
### values are the same
### but think about this for a second--that means that every
### data point has the same value for that feature!
### why would you rescale it?  Or even use it at all?

	max_arr = max(arr)
	min_arr = min(arr)

	for n in arr:
		try:
			scaled.append(round((n - min_arr) / (max_arr -min_arr),3))
		except:
			scaled.append(1)
	return scaled
